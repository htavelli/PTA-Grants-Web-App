            Complete the application on this webpage.  If the item is for individual classroom use, submit it as a
            teacher/individual.  If you are representing a larger team, submit it through the department/team option.

            Please do not request funds for Teachers Pay Teachers or similar services. You may use your classroom
             supply funds for those expenses rather than completing a grant application.

            Please do not request funds for projects that begin before the end of the grant cycle closing date.
             We are unable to decide on grants to approve before the application period closes.

            We urge you to check that no other funding sources, including funds from
            <fmt:message bundle="${school}" key="label.header.school_principal"></fmt:message>, are available for your request.
             You may be able to receive the funds more quickly if another source is available.  Additionally, it
              will expedite the grants process and may lead to more grants being awarded by the PTA.
