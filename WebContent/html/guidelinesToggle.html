      Staff may request PTA funds for equipment/materials, supplies, technology, field trips,
      experiences, or training. Items may be requested for individual classroom use, shared/department use, or school-wide use.
      Capital or other school-wide improvements will also be considered. The PTA grants committee members review the applications
      and then vote on which applicants receive funding based on the goals and objectives of the project, the number of students
      reached through the project, and the uniqueness of the project. Usually there are ample funds to cover most projects.
